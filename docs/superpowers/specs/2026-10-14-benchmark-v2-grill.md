# Benchmark Mode v2 — Grill with Docs (working design)

Date: 2026-10-14
Status: **Design interview in progress — Rounds 1–4 decided; Round 5 unanswered**
Owner: eitaar
Scope: research-oriented improvements to driichi's Benchmark Mode, not implementation approval.

## Sources and invariants

- Existing vocabulary: `CONTEXT.md`.
- Shipped v1 specification: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-29-benchmark-mode-design.md`.
- Existing Run state: `crates/double_riichi_core/src/room.rs`.
- Persistent Run records and statistics: `crates/double_riichi_server/src/storage.rs`, `migrations/0006_benchmark.sql`.
- Existing UI: `frontend/src/benchmark.tsx`.

Keep v1's currently shipped behavior as the compatibility baseline. A design idea below is **not** a requirement or implemented feature until the owner decides it.

## Decisions — Round 1 (2026-10-14)

### D1. Product goal — DECIDED

**Choice:** Research and experimentation platform.

The goal is broader than ranking bots by playing strength. The platform should support rigorous AI-related experiments and the evaluation of changes to software participants. The broad evidence categories and Experiment purpose have now been selected in Rounds 2–3; exact statistical methods, data contracts, and Experiment state transitions remain open.

### D2. Compatibility strategy — DECIDED

**Choice:** Extend existing Benchmark Mode with backward compatibility.

Preserve the semantics of existing v1 Benchmark Runs and existing API consumers. Additive versioned capabilities are preferable to silently changing v1's contract. Round 2 selected an additive `Experiment` concept grouping Benchmark Runs. Round 3 approved both attaching historic Runs and creating new Runs under an Experiment. Round 4 limits Experiment registration to Runs whose relevant comparison conditions can be verified; the evidence schema and Experiment lifecycle remain open.

### D3. Primary deployment — DECIDED

**Choice:** Self-hosted.

Prioritize one operator controlling a self-hosted instance, rather than building a hosted leaderboard, multi-tenant service, or distributed cluster. Public hosting and collaboration are not goals for the initial v2 scope.

## Decisions — Round 2 (2026-10-14)

### D4. Experiment groups Benchmark Runs — DECIDED (Q4: B)

Introduce **Experiment** as a research-level concept for organizing and comparing multiple existing Benchmark Runs. Preserve Run identity, fixed-roster semantics, recorded Match data, and existing v1 API behavior. Round 3 decided that an Experiment supports both adding previously completed Runs and creating/running new Runs through the Admin interface. This does not authorize a general workflow pipeline.

### D5. Paired Evaluation — DECIDED IN PRINCIPLE (Q5: C)

Support comparisons using controlled shared random conditions to reduce the effect of chance. This selects **paired evaluation**, not a specific seeding algorithm. Round 3 requires recorded fixed seeds and equitable rotation of Seats. Round 4 allows the Admin to supply a root seed or let the server generate one; both record the actual chosen seed. Exact expansion/stream ownership, pair identification, and interpretation of diverging decisions remain open. A common seed alone does not establish equivalent observed game states.

### D6. Outcome + reliability + statistical evidence — DECIDED (Q6: B)

Report and assess game outcomes, runtime/reliability evidence, and statistical uncertainty. Round 3 requires Match-level summary data and optional diagnostic logs. Round 4 requires server-observed latency for all eligible bot decisions and optionally collects agent-reported inference time **separately**. The exact server timing boundaries, reliability categories, confidence-interval method, and log retention remain open. This does not select full decision-level trace collection for the initial v2 release.

### D7. Recovery at Match boundaries — DECIDED IN PRINCIPLE (Q7: B)

Support resuming eligible interrupted v2 experiments/runs **only at a verified Match boundary**, preserving already-durable outcomes. No replay-based mid-Match continuation is authorized. Round 3 requires an explicit Admin action to resume after interruption (no automatic resume). Round 4 requires recording failed attempts separately and allowing a new Match attempt with the original planned seed and fixed roster after Admin Resume. Eligibility checks, retry limits, bot state reset, and idempotency conditions remain open. Keep v1's existing fail-closed interrupted-Run behavior unchanged.

### D8. Web UI is the primary interface — DECIDED (Q8: A)

Make the Admin Web UI the primary mechanism for configuring, observing, and comparing v2 experiments. Do not require an editable headless manifest or CLI as a v2 design prerequisite; existing APIs remain compatible.

### D9. Admin live-observation focus — DECIDED USER REQUIREMENT

During a running Benchmark, authenticated Admins can inspect **all bots' concealed hands** and switch which player's hand is the observation focus. Focus changes are strictly read-only: they neither impersonate a Participant nor alter a seat, Controller, legal-action visibility, RNG state, or Run progress.

**Existing implementation:** `Audience::BenchmarkAdmin` already exposes all current hands to an authorized Admin. `frontend/src/benchmark.tsx` currently polls the Admin live endpoint at one-second intervals and renders `ThreeTable` with `surface="replay"`; there is no explicit focus selector in the inspected implementation. Round 3 decided that selecting a bot both changes the 3D table's viewing perspective and enlarges that bot's hand. The intended choice is a read-only presentation transformation (no privileged Player View impersonation). Round 4 requires selecting the Participant identity, not the seat, so the view tracks that bot across seat rotations. View defaults, transitions, and live-update transport remain open.

## Decisions — Round 3 (2026-10-14)

### D10. Existing and newly created Runs in an Experiment — DECIDED (Q9: C)

Experiment supports **both** attaching previously completed Benchmark Runs for retrospective comparison and creating/running new Benchmark Runs from its Admin Web UI. A Run remains independently addressable and its committed Match results must not be silently rewritten when linked. Round 4 restricts admission to Runs whose relevant experiment conditions can be verified; historical Runs without sufficient evidence are not retroactively treated as reproducible or admitted. The exact verifiability criteria and whether linking is reversible are open decisions.

### D11. Fixed random seed and balanced seats — DECIDED (Q10: B)

For paired comparisons, record/fix the random seed used for evaluation and **rotate the seats evenly** among Participants across the comparison schedule. Preserve exact pairing metadata; equal seed identifiers are not sufficient proof of equivalent draw trajectories once decisions diverge. Round 4 allows either an Admin-supplied or server-generated seed, and requires preserving the actual seed. The RNG stream protocol, seed expansion, and the definition of valid pairing are not yet chosen.

### D12. Match-level reliability evidence with optional diagnostics — DECIDED (Q11: B)

Store outcome and reliability measurements at **Match granularity** by default; expose **detailed logs only when needed**. Diagnostic logging must be controllable and must not be assumed on by default. Server-observed latency is required while optional bot-reported inference time is recorded separately and clearly labeled; timing boundaries, log limits and retention, collection overhead, and statistical estimators remain undecided.

### D13. Admin-initiated Match-boundary recovery — DECIDED (Q12: A)

Resumption of eligible interrupted v2 work requires the **Admin to choose Resume** in the UI. Already committed Matches remain valid; an incomplete Match cannot be marked completed and there is no mid-Match restoration. Round 4 requires retaining a failed attempt record and restarting its scheduled Match from the beginning with the **same seed and roster** using a **new Match ID** following Admin Resume. The original failed attempt stays excluded from result statistics. Proving environment/model compatibility, resetting state correctly, bounding retries, and atomic/idempotent accounting remain open. The legacy v1 interruption policy is unchanged.

### D14. Focused 3D spectator view plus enlarged hand — DECIDED (Q13: C)

For a running Benchmark, Admin may select a bot to **rotate the 3D viewpoint toward that bot** and **enlarge/show that bot's current concealed hand**. Switching observation focus changes presentation only, not projection authorization, who is acting, game state, legal actions, or private information available to bots. The display must maintain correct Player/Seat/score correspondence in 3p/4p while focusing or rotating; the reported normal-Match center-score association defect remains unverified as fixed. Round 4 makes Observation Focus follow the selected **Participant ID** across Seat rotations. Selecting a different bot changes presentation only; defaults, live synchronization and 3D transition style are open.

## Decisions — Round 4 (2026-10-14)

### D15. Strict Experiment registration — DECIDED (Q14: C)

Only a Benchmark Run whose **relevant experiment conditions are fully verifiable** can be admitted to an Experiment, whether it was created by that Experiment or previously completed. In particular, missing or merely invented seed/agent provenance must never be backfilled and presented as verified. Existing v1 history is **preserved and still accessible outside Experiment**, regardless of eligibility. Verifiability is a product eligibility gate, not a claim of mathematical equality of different bot trajectories. What evidence counts as sufficient verification is the next decision.

**Code constraint:** Current v1 `BenchmarkRunRecord` captures roster/seat/results, status and game mode but does not itself contain a recorded random seed or immutable bot/checkpoint and engine provenance; therefore existing stored v1 Runs do not automatically satisfy this gate.

### D16. Admin-entered or auto-generated seed — DECIDED (Q15: C)

The Admin UI supports either **specifying a seed** or requesting that the **server generate a seed**. Whichever source is chosen, the effective seed and derivation/provenance must be persisted with the planned comparison conditions; never confuse an omitted/default seed with a recorded reproducible seed. The algorithm for deriving per-Match or per-Kyoku randomness and tying equivalent scheduled blocks together is not decided.

### D17. Separately labeled server and bot timing — DECIDED (Q16: B)

The server **must record its own observed response-latency measurements**; instrumented bots **may additionally supply inference-only timing**. The two are not interchangeable; do not treat a bot's self-reported timing as independently verified or as the primary cross-protocol metric. Exact decision start/end boundaries, missing/invalid responses, and per-Match aggregation are to be specified later.

### D18. Retry interrupted Match from start — DECIDED (Q17: A)

After Admin-triggered Resume, preserve the failed attempt and retry its originally scheduled Match **from the start** using the same recorded seed and Participant roster, with a **new Match ID**. Never count an incomplete attempt as a successfully completed Match; never mutate previous committed results. The replay/Match/attempt identity model, reset/verification checks, and retry budget remain open.

**Safety edge case:** A connected Bot may retain in-memory state across attempts or be replaced with a different checkpoint. The same seed and Participant ID are insufficient to guarantee equivalence. Resumption must not silently claim valid pairing until this is addressed.

### D19. Follow Participant through Seat rotations — DECIDED (Q18: A)

The Admin's Observation Focus is anchored to the selected software **Participant**, not its current Seat. When the next Match rotates seats, keep the same bot in focus, change the table viewpoint to its new Seat, and enlarge that bot's hand. The score displayed near any Seat must always refer to the actual Participant occupying that Seat. Do not conflate viewer perspective and authoritative game state.

### D20. Sequential Runs per Experiment — DECIDED (Q19: A)

Within each Experiment, at most **one Experiment-managed Benchmark Run** is active at once; its planned Runs execute in sequence. **Do not restrict independent legacy v1 Runs** because of this v2 rule. Exactly how the queue starts, pauses, advances and completes remains open.

## Verified v1 baseline (not v2 decisions)

- A Benchmark Run has a fixed participant roster, rotating seats, and 1–1,000 completed and durably recorded Matches.
- Its statistics are mean placement, first-place rate, and cumulative score relative to the table mean.
- Run history survives process restarts, but running Runs become interrupted and are not resumed automatically.
- Reproducible seed input and cross-Run ranking are explicitly excluded by the v1 design.
- MJAI, MCP, and Built-in Bots are existing participant kinds; Benchmark Mode does not admit Human players.
- Current Run identity and results belong to Participants, not to the Bot Token or displayed name.

## Optional extensions — NOT APPROVED

These remain candidates, not implementation mandates:

1. An optional central model registry UI (immutable provenance needed for strict Experiment admission is no longer optional, but its storage representation and verification rules remain open).
2. Exact deterministic replay and RNG stream design, beyond the agreed Paired Evaluation goal.
3. Model regression thresholds, rankings, and publication of evidence reports.
4. Offline decision evaluation and detailed per-decision traces, which are not selected for initial v2.
5. Dataset/replay export and reproducible experiment manifests; Web UI is the selected primary interface.
6. Parallel workload scheduling and resource quotas beyond the existing self-hosted architecture.
7. A generalized automatic recovery engine, beyond the agreed *boundary-only* resumption capability.

### Round 5 questions — awaiting owner

- **Q20, minimum verification evidence:** A — verified match setup (rules/mode, seed, engine revision, time control) without attesting agent build; B — A plus reproducible/verifiable bot artifact or model-checkpoint identity, rejecting unverified agents; C — B plus an integrity-checked signed runtime environment for all bots. **Recommendation B:** strict scientific admission requires more than a display name or Bot Token. Later define how self-hosted MJAI/MCP bots supply genuinely verifiable artifact identity without trusting a mere typed name.
- **Q21, seed expansion:** A — one seeded mutable RNG shared by all gameplay events; B — a recorded root seed deterministically expands into per-Match seeds with separate labeled RNG streams to reduce action-order coupling; C — a pre-generated immutable full wall/deal script for every Kyoku irrespective of branching. **Recommendation B:** reproducibility without claiming divergent agent choices share an identical observed trace.
- **Q22, server latency boundary:** A — first response byte/frame, regardless of validity; B — elapsed time until a complete valid legal action is accepted; C — record both first response and valid action latency, with errors separately. **Recommendation C:** distinguishes transport responsiveness from usable decisions, if implementable consistently across MJAI/MCP/built-in bot actions.
- **Q23, repeated retry budget:** A — one retry total then terminal failure; B — up to two retries (three attempts including original) with explicit Admin action at each resumption; C — unlimited Admin-triggered retries. **Recommendation B:** retain bounded evidence and avoid trapping a self-hosted instance in repeated failed trials.
- **Q24, Admin live update transport:** A — keep the existing 1-second polling; B — authenticated SSE projection updates with snapshot/reconnect and revocation checks, keeping polling fallback; C — dedicated WebSocket. **Recommendation B:** responsive read-only spectatorship without replacing the existing table renderer or relaxing Admin permissions.
- **Q25, Experiment configuration edit policy:** A — freely edit planned Runs/seed/roster after results exist; B — freeze comparability-defining settings once the first Match starts, allowing only annotations and administrative pause/cancel; C — version configurations in-place while separating result cohorts. **Recommendation B:** simple immutable comparison conditions, preserving interpretability and replayable schedules.
- **Q26, diagnostic log retention:** A — retain every detailed event indefinitely; B — configurable quota/expiry with conservative self-hosted defaults, while durable per-Match summaries remain; C — diagnostics are ephemeral and vanish after completion. **Recommendation B:** avoid surprise disk growth without losing authoritative outcomes or failure evidence.

### Deferred decisions

After this frontier is resolved, consider: verifiable agent/engine artifact ownership and compatible version checks; deterministic RNG seed format/streams; paired block and sample construction; seat-balanced statistical estimators and uncertainty; per-Match latency aggregation and invalid/timeouts; reset semantics and transactional resume idempotency; observing future wall privacy limits; Admin UI defaults and 3D focus animations; lifecycle of planned Runs when canceled; maximum scheduled Runs/matches and disk quota boundaries; API/schema migrations; automated visual acceptance tests for the reported center-score/Seat mismatch.

## Reported visual defect — status UNVERIFIED (2026-10-14)

**User report:** The central table score display was buggy at some point; the user is unsure whether it has since been fixed. Preserve this as an **unconfirmed existing UI regression**, not a verified current defect and not a completed fix.

**Current code evidence:** `frontend/src/game/table-center-pixels.ts` paints per-seat score and round facts into a 2048px Canvas; `three-table-renderer.tsx` memoizes these pixels by score and table facts and forwards a center bitmap to a dedicated Worker; `three-table-worker.tsx` loads the bitmap; `three-table.tsx` separately supplies an accessible score list. `three-table.test.tsx` checks that score changes trigger canvas paint (e.g. 25,000 to 27,600), but that unit test does not prove correct position/orientation or final output pixels on the live GPU.

**User clarification (2026-10-14):** Symptom category **B1 — the displayed score appeared at another player's seat**, rather than being associated with its rightful player's position. This is a *reported Seat-to-score presentation mismatch*, not evidence of incorrect authoritative scoring. The report predates this check; whether it still reproduces on the current build is unknown.

**Surface confirmed by user (2026-10-14):** The B1 score-to-seat mismatch was observed in **ordinary live play (normal Room Match)**. The user has **not verified whether the same issue appears in Replay or Benchmark Admin live observation**; neither may be asserted buggy or fixed. The user has not specified 3p vs 4p.

**Unknown:** Whether the mismatch is a consistent Seat swap or intermittent, whether it occurs after orientation changes, and whether it still reproduces on the current build. Replay and Benchmark Admin view remain untested by the user.

**Required verification before accepting an Admin-focus UI:** Reproduce or explicitly mark unreproduced on the current build. Assign distinct, unmistakable scores to each Seat and verify every displayed score sits adjacent to the correct Participant for all seats in both 3p and 4p; compare against authoritative Match/Room state. Repeat on live, replay and Benchmark Admin surfaces, after seat rotation, after a score update, and when Admin Observation Focus changes. Check visual output pixels—not just text paint calls—in the GPU/Worker renderer and make sure the read-only fallback/text view reports the same mapping. Preserve Admin visibility boundaries. A passing CI result alone is not a visual-fix claim.

**Next clarification (only if needed later):** Determine whether the ordinary live Match was 3p or 4p and whether the mismatch was consistent; **do not ask again which surface**, as normal live play is confirmed. The canvas painter and 3D layout both use `tableSeatGeometry(projection.mode, projection.viewer_seat)` in the current code, which merits visual verification but does **not** establish a root cause. Do not change product code during the design interview.

## Decision discipline

- Do not implement v2 features, run migrations, publish releases, or merge until all relevant decisions are settled and the owner confirms shared understanding.
- Update `CONTEXT.md` only with approved domain vocabulary; keep implementation options in this working document.
- Create an ADR only for a decided, consequential and non-obvious trade-off that would be costly to reverse.
- Preserve original v1 documentation unchanged; distinguish implemented facts, owner decisions and unapproved suggestions.
